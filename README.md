<h2>Created database</h2>
<p>I have created cloud database on “MongoDB Atlas”. MongoDB is an open-source document database built on horizontal scale-out architecture. Main advantage of using this database is that each row in a MongoDB database is a document described in JSON form instead of storing data in tables of rows or columns like SQL databases. Moreover, MongoDB is a powerful way to store and retrieve data that allows developers to move fast.</p>
<h2>Developed APIs</h2>
<p>To develop my RESTful APIs, I have used Flask Framework. Main benefit of using Flask framework was that it is a very small and lightweight Python web framework. It provides useful tools and features for creating web applications and APIs in Python easily. Also, while using this framework we have to follow very minimal setup to integrate NoSQL Database like MongoDB database.</p>
<h2>Hosted APIs on Heroku</h2>
<p>As a next step of my project, I have hosted my mobile application APIs on cloud. For this purpose, I have used Heroku platform. Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) which is present on the cloud. It basically allows the software developers to create, run, monitor and scale web applications. Other benefit of using Heroku is that it integrates with GitHub  easily to pull code present on Github to applications running on Heroku. Once Github and Heroku are integrated, developers pushes their code on Github repository and it automatically updates on Heroku platform.</p>
